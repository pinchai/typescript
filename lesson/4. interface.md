# Interface

In TypeScript, an **interface** is used to define the **structure of an object**.
Itâ€™s a way to describe the shape of data, including properties and method signatures.

##Basic Interface Example
```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30
};
```

##Optional Properties
Use `?` to mark a property as optional.
```ts
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description?: string;  // optional
}
```

---

##Methods in Interfaces
You can define method signatures as well.
```ts
interface Animal {
  name: string;
  speak(): void;
}

const dog: Animal = {
  name: "Buddy",
  speak() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
};
```
